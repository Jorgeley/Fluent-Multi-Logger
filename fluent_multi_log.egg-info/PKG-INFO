Description: ## Fluent Multi Log
        This is a multi log fluent classes project, the main idea is to have different logs files, formats etc.
        
        The main Log class has all the main methods, the AnotherLog and AnotherOneLog extend it and have their own format and configuration.
        
        It can be extended to implement more functionalities.
